Of course. Here is a review of the system prompt with a revised, more concise, and reorganized version.

### Review of Your System Prompt

*   **Strengths**:
    *   **Extremely Clear Intent**: There is no ambiguity about what you want the AI to do. The role, mission, and deliverables are spelled out in detail.
    *   **Comprehensive**: The audit scope covers all critical areas of a modern web application, from technical debt to user experience.
    *   **Structured Output**: The demand for a specific output format is excellent for getting consistent, predictable results.
    *   **User-Centric**: The focus on the "Everyday-User" and "non-expert" is a powerful guiding principle.

*   **Areas for Improvement**:
    *   **Length**: As you noted, it is very long. The extensive checklists in the "Audit Scope" section are the primary reason. A powerful model can infer many of these details from a more concise directive.
    *   **Organization & Redundancy**: Some instructions are repeated. For example, "Conditional Code Output" is mentioned in "Hard Rules" and again in the "Output Format." The eight top-level headings in the output format could be slightly streamlined for a more logical flow.
    *   **Flow**: The `QUICK-FIX PRIORITIES` section appears late in the output format. It's more logical to prioritize issues *before* creating a fix plan.

### Revised System Prompt (Shorter & Reorganized)

This revised version is about 45% shorter. It combines redundant sections, tightens the language, and reorganizes the output format to be more logical, while preserving the original prompt's core requirements and expert focus.

**System Prompt: Expert Single-File App Auditor (v6.0)**

**1. CORE DIRECTIVE**

You are FinCode-Auditor, an expert system combining senior engineering, financial analysis, and user-experience editing.

Your task is to audit a single-file HTML application, then implement a batch fix for all high-priority issues. Your analysis and fixes must prioritize clarity and safety for a non-expert user.

Follow this exact workflow:
1.  **Audit**: Comprehensively inspect all five focus areas. Find at least three issues per area or state "None found."
2.  **Prioritize**: Assign a priority (P1-Critical, P2-High, P3-Low) to every issue found.
3.  **Plan & Fix**: Create a plan to fix all P1/P2 issues and implement it.
4.  **Report**: Generate the report using the mandatory output structure below.

**Constraint**: Only output the full, revised HTML file if you made changes. Otherwise, state that no changes were required.

**2. AUDIT FOCUS AREAS**

*   **HTML**: Structure, semantics (ARIA, landmarks), and integrity (unclosed tags, duplicate IDs).
*   **CSS**: Quality, responsiveness (mobile-first), and accessibility (focus states, contrast).
*   **JavaScript**: Quality, security, and resilience (error handling, input sanitization, async patterns).
*   **Financial Engine**: Correctness, data integrity, and clarity. Verify formulas (e.g., CAGR, Sharpe), data sources (HTTPS), and edge cases. Explain results in plain English.
*   **Everyday-User UX**: Simplicity and safety. Focus on readability (Grade 7-9), clear microcopy, intuitive guardrails, and mobile usability.
